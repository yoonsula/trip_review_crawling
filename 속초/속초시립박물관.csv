龜逵???戟逵 鬼??逵剋??克逵?, 5 stars ,the folk village and the sokcho city museum are nearby  i recommend visiting both sites  in the museum you need to learn what a variety of ways you can learn the history of the native land of children from a very young age  this is just unbelievable  the folklore village vividly demonstrates the daily life and life of the gangwon do province in the joseon era  and i personally simply adore the folk villages in all countries  but the most incredible exhibit is a recreated workers  village during the korean war and immediately after it  frost on the skin  as people lived only 70 years ago   in shacks with an area of less than 10 square meters  m  pasted over by newspapers  and photographs of those times and the 60s     i could not tear myself away from them  nothing to do with the sparkling and prosperous modern korea  here you understand what a hardworking people can achieve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 70                                       10                                                      60,2 years ago,속초시립박물관,강원도 속초시 신흥2길 16,38.2005142,128.5373544
Jung Ro, 5 stars ,it gives to know a little of the culture  the history of the city of sokcho formed largely by the refugees of north korea after the war that divided the country  it has buildings that reproduce the way they lived  there is also a reproduction of traditional houses from various regions of the country  forming a village  i saw a folk dance performance the day i visited  and there was a royal wedding party in the traditional format  there is a museum that tells the story of a reign that extinguished  situated in present day north korea  a way of preserving the memory of its descendants  current residents of the city  the larger museum has a very educative part about culture with the right to experiences that especially enchant the children  it is worth knowing      d  para conhecer um pouco da cultura  a hist ria da cidade de sokcho formado em boa parte pelos refugiados da cor ia do norte ap s a guerra que dividiu o pa s  tem constru  es que reproduzem a forma como viviam  tamb m h  uma reprodu  o de casas tradicionais de v rias regioes do pa s  formando uma vila  vi uma apresenta  o de dan a folclorica no dia que visitei  e houve uma festa real de casamento no formato tradicional  h  um museu que conta a hist ria de um reinado que extinguiu  situado na atual cor ia do norte  uma forma de preservar a mem ria dos seus descendentes  atuais moradores da cidade  o museu maior tem uma parte bastante educativa sobre a cultura com direito a experi ncias que encantam sobretudo as crian as  vale a pena conhecer,3 years ago,속초시립박물관,강원도 속초시 신흥2길 16,38.2005142,128.5373544
