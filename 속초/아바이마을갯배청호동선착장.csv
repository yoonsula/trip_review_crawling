Cho Caren, 5 stars ,really small town with a couple of restaurants and cafe  the boat is a 2 minute ride and it cost  1000 round trip  there isn t much to see other than the places to eat and the beach  if you want to just walk around and enjoy the beach  then you will definitely enjoy it  if you are going with the mindset of finding a huge attraction this is not your place  it feel more like a place for relaxing and taking pictures of the scenery  i found a small vender selling honey and i bought some honeycomb  even though it was super expensive  i still enjoyed it,a year ago,0,0,38.2029678,128.5903727
