Jessica Horine,5,warning to westerners  you will be naked   this hot spring   spa is popular  the overflow parking lots are huge  on this september weekend it wasn t too bad  full of hikers  including us    when you go in there is one small sign in english  we did the hot springs for 9 000kw each  you can get a family room for 3 hrs for 60 000kw for private soak  but then you would miss a cool experience   women go downstairs  men up  sounds like mens  experience very similar after discussing with the hubby  locker room is huge  the attendant saw me looking lost and befuddled and despite no english  showed me my designated locker  the towels and the entrance  there are multiple pools i ve various temps ranging from 38 41c  each is marked  some have jets  my fav    some were for the neck  amazing   you could also lay down on the floor with a head block and nap  glorious    then i discovered the outdoor pools  two pools outside under a pagoda with nice surrounds   landscaping  another area to lay down and some teak lounge chairs   perfect way to experience a culture and relax at the same time  no one there was shy about their bodies so you get comfortable really fast  sorry no pictures obviously   super clean facility  you can also get a massage for about 12 000kw,3 years ago ,척산온천휴양촌,강원도 속초시 노학동 관광로 327,38.190086,128.540571
