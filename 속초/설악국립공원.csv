T Q, 5 stars ,i visited seoraksan during the pandemic at the end of apr 2022 and went up via the ulsanbawi route  it is recommended that you get the naver map to help you plan in advance  but the road signs there are pretty clear  it is also advisable to arrive earlier before 9 am as it tends to get really crowded after 10  that was what i experienced when i descended the mountain  do also note the the price of entrance ticket is now 4500 won  you could get there with bus 7 if you live near the coastal area  and the bus comes every 20 min or so  journey took about an hour to reach the seorakdong entrance  be rewarded by the beautiful scenery,3 months ago,설악국립공원,강원도 속초시 설악동,38.1573652,128.4333334
Bryan Rosenraouch, 5 stars ,seoraksan is the highest mountain in the taebaek mountain range in the gangwon province in eastern south korea  it is located in a national park near the city of sokcho  after the hallasan volcano on jeju island and jirisan in the south  seoraksan is the third highest mountain in south korea  the daechongbong peak of seoraksan reaches 1 708 meters  5 603 feet   the mountain is sometimes considered the backbone of south korea  i recommend to bring with you enough drinks and food as the walk and climbing to the top is long which takes ten hours but it is worth every minute with all the nature and the unusual and unforgettable views,5 months ago,설악국립공원,강원도 속초시 설악동,38.1573652,128.4333334
