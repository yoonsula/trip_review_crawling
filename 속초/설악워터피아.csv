Jan-Michael Buckowitz, 5 stars ,although seorak waterpia is one of the oldest water parks in korea  it has been continually expanded and modernized over time  on a huge area there are partly covered baths   such as wave pool  pool for toddlers  swimming pool for larger    food stalls  where you can buy typical korean snacks as well as hot dogs or hamburgers  the outdoor area of the facility offers various pools where the water is provided with a current  so that it is easy  almost without swimming movements  to be carried only by the flow through the twisting waterway  also wave baths  a variety of whirlpools  pools with water temperatures of 40 degrees celsius  a huge family pool where visitors are encouraged to do gymnastics  the highlights are 3 water slides  1 of them leisurely  the next larger already much faster and steeper  topped by the largest  which offers a real kick  overall  a real experience  at the moment  the bath in the outskirts is being rebuilt structurally  it is also remarkable how the safety is taken care of  so that you can go with children safely  about every 20 meters there is a lifeguard  overall  really worth a day s stay  best visit during the week  the rush is enormous  for europeans it is certainly very unusual  especially the entrance area  since there are no changing rooms  you will find the section for women and men  moved to coram publico  just as the shower is done naked after the bath and before the eyes of other same sex people  but this is a topic that actually requires a separate rubric  because the sexuality in korea differs significantly from the european  there are many pitfalls for visitors from abroad      seorak waterpia ist zwar eines der  ltesten erlebnisb der koreas  es wurde aber immer wieder im laufe der zeit erweitert und modernisiert  auf einem riesigen gel nde finden sich teils  berdachte b der   wie wellenbad  becken f r kleinkinder  schwimmbecken f r gr  ere      essensst nde  wo sie neben typisch koreanischen snacks auch hotdogs oder hamburger kaufen k nnen  der au enbereich der anlage bietet verschiedene becken  in denen das wasser mit einer str mung versehen wird  so dass man m helos  fast ohne schwimmbewegungen nur von der str mung durch die verwundene wasserstra e getragen wird  auch hier wellenb der  eine vielzahl von whirlpools  becken mit wassertemperaturen von 40 grad celsius  ein riesiges familienbecken  in dem die besucher zu gymnastik angeregt werden  als highlights finden sich 3 wasserrutschen  1 davon gem chlich  die n chst gr  ere schon deutlich schneller und steiler  getoppt von der gr  ten  die einen echten kick bietet  insgesamt ein echtes erlebnis  zur zeit wird das bad im randgebiet wieder baulich erweitert  bemerkenswert auch  wie sich um die sicherheit gesorgt wird  so dass man unbesorgt mit kindern hingehen kann  ca  alle 20 meter findet sich ein e rettungsschwimmer in  insgesamt wirklich einen tag aufenthalt wert  am besten unter der woche besuchen  der andrang ist enorm  f r europ er ist es sicherlich sehr ungewohnt  vor allem der eingangsbereich  da es keine umkleidekabinen gibt  sie finden den bereich f r frauen und den f r m nner  umgezogen wird sich in coram publico  genauso wie die dusche nach dem bad nackt und vor den augen der anderen gleichgeschlechtlichen personen vollzogen wird   aber das ist ein thema  das eigentlich eine eigene rubrik erfordert   denn die sexualit t in korea unterscheidet sich wesentlich von der europ ischen  hier gibt es viele fallstricke f r besucher aus dem ausland,3 years ago,설악워터피아,강원도 속초시 미시령로2983번길 111,38.2081431,128.5272503
