Jack, 4 stars ,overall a great market for some genuine korean food at a decent price  there is a lot of variety and countless shops to choose from  that said  there are some things to look out for  first  a lot of the shops have a propensity to precook their food then reheat it when you purchase it  or not at all  it s a good idea to insist on the freshly made ones and definitely do not buy anything that s turned stone cold or looks like it sat around all day  the fried foods are a prime example of this  second  if you are adventurous then you should venture into a seafood shop where they have fresh live seafood on display out front  the best ones are in the basement of a building  you ll know by walking down some stairs past the restrooms  there s a huge sprawling area filled with koreans eating fresh seafood and sitting at low tables  to eat here  you ll have to negotiate the price of some amount of seafood you ll pick from the tanks  i repeat  you must negotiate the price of the seafood lower and don t ever let them lead you to believe the free  service  food they give you is actually worth anything  good luck,5 years ago,속초관광수산시장,강원도 속초시 중앙동 중앙로147번길 16,38.2046527,128.5869323
