Ryan Lee, 4 stars ,overall  we ordered the basic meal set we found at the daepo port seafood market as there are too many stalls to choose from  and we were happy with our choice  the crab was juicy and sweet and the crab ramen was so yummy that we couldn t stop drinking the soup  the soup was spicy and addictive  three fried rice is a little too much for 2 of us  we tried to finish it by finding a new way to eat it which is to have a spoonful of rice and dipped into the soup  it is a great combination  the owner is really nice and friendly  they will tell us which side dish is to go with the main dish  and this made the food taste even better  my thoughts  actually  the seafood in sokcho is not that cheap  if you see the price for the big red snow crab  it can cost up to 100 000 won or more  when you enter the daepo port seafood market you will be overwhelmed with lots of choices  the ajummas can be a little aggressive while trying to bring you into their stall   if you know what you want to eat and compare the price around  after the comparison  if you find that it is not worth to spend so much on crab  can consider eating the cheaper option  squid sundae which can be counted as seafood too,2 years ago,대포항,강원 속초시 대포동,38.173686,128.6070709
龜逵???戟逵 鬼??逵剋??克逵?, 5 stars ,the beauty of that place  in fine weather  you can spend several wonderful hours admiring the sea and the city  which looks very beautiful from here  nearby there are a lot of restaurants where you can eat such fresh seafood and fish that you will not find everywhere  after all  they are literally just caught    ,2 years ago,대포항,강원 속초시 대포동,38.173686,128.6070709
