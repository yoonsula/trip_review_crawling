Clark Swindell,3,the hotel facility is older but clean and seems to be well maintaind   we arrived on a friday night and got a western style room  i e  has a bed    room is wide and clean but very dated   as with most korean lodging  the matress may be harder than the floor    bathroom was clean but very dated and small   had trouble sitring on the toilet because it is almost butted up against the wall   overall not bad just overpriced even with admission to the hotspring sauna included    not a bad place  and if you like the bath house hot springs great  but its not your modern lodging facility,4 years ago,0,0,38.1870714,128.5437151
