JuanFS,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Interesting but not exciting,the temple offers a temple stay program  either in common room or in individual  2 people  room  men and women separated  with toilets inside the room  it is a temple like the most you usually can see in korea  but the location and surroundings are great  in korea most temples offer a temple stay which has a different style depending whether focusing on spiritual relaxation  religious or mediation program  this one is more a relaxation example  with some possibilities of prayer time  tea time  talking with the monk in charge or some activities  set a buddhist rosary    the meal are quite basic and under the temple rules interesting but only for  fans,"August 28, 2018",삼화사,강원도 동해시 삼화로 584,37.4638354,129.0143586

Daniel G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Frozen waterfall,i took bus 12 4 from the donghae bus terminal  and arrived at the temple about an hour later  the temple itself was not the most splendid i have seen  but the setting is nice  and the ice on the creek  and upstream the frozen waterfalls made for a very nice hike,"March 6, 2018",삼화사,강원도 동해시 삼화로 584,37.4638354,129.0143586
Lainchan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,A temple inside Murreung Valley,we came when it is almost dark  so all the shops are closed  even the temple is closed so we could only walk around the yard but cannot go inside the temple  we saw the banner that this temple offers temple stay program and there are some ppl staying that nite  i cannot imagine staying in the temple in such a cold weather and the toilet is outside,"January 26, 2016",삼화사,강원도 동해시 삼화로 584,37.4638354,129.0143586
Eric K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Location,there is nothing particularily outstanding about the temple itself  not that this is not a nice temple  it s just that after seeing dozens it  like most  does not stand out from the rest  it is the location that is great  climb the moutain trail and you will be rewarded with scenic vistas  waterfalls  and much more  i wish we had time to climb to the top of the mountain  this was our favorite activity in korea  this is a very popular hiking area  so to avoid the crouds i would recommend getting started as early a possible  we stayed at a hotel less than a block from the trailhead  and were there as soon as they opened  the hike up was nice and there were very few people  on the way down we passed lots of people heading up the trail   we would definitely like to return and attempt to reach the top,"September 8, 2015",삼화사,강원도 동해시 삼화로 584,37.4638354,129.0143586
Sheryl A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice temple... but it is all about the Park,take a bus here from donghae  1200 won  as it gets busy can take 1 hr   even on weekdays  the temple is accessed via the park  4000 won   information has no english maps and peak no english  the fairly plain temple  being renovated  is about 800m in and on the left  just follow the main routes and ask koreans they are a friendly helpful bunch   see our review of the valley on tripadvisor for the park and maps,"October 7, 2014",삼화사,강원도 동해시 삼화로 584,37.4638354,129.0143586
Linda T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Peaceful Buddhist temple, good waterfalls, friendly monks",the main temple is nice  but nothing too special  however there is a second smaller temple about 1 5 km up the mountain that can make even the most jaded traveller be thankful to be alive  there are 3 or 4 waterfalls along the path  one is 40 50 meters tall  the path is well marked and sometimes one can get a monk to escort them up to the temple  the monks study medicinal plants  so if you can find one that speaks english you can learn about some of the plants and their uses,"November 21, 2013",삼화사,강원도 동해시 삼화로 584,37.4638354,129.0143586
