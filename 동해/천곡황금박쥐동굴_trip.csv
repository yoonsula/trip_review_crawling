Jason R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,A nice little cave right in town,this cave is very centrally located  in a parking lot in town  the price is cheap  and they do make you wear a helmet  so we brought our own caving helmets and they did not object  the cave is not that large  we toured the whole thing in about 30 minutes  the stainless steel walkways are everywhere  in some places the ceilings are quite low  and they also make use of the formed plastic flooring which is not heels friendly  ladies  all in all  a nice cave  but the smallest of the ones in the area,"October 30, 2016",Ãµ°îÈ²±Ý¹ÚÁãµ¿±¼,°­¿øµµ µ¿ÇØ½Ã µ¿±¼·Î 50,37.517365,129.1102094
LiketoeatCincinnati,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Cool Cave in City,the cave is right in the city and is convenient to highways and hotels  it takes about 45 minutes to walk the cave  but  you have to watch your head as the clearance is very low  the structures found within are really cool to see,"October 25, 2016",Ãµ°îÈ²±Ý¹ÚÁãµ¿±¼,°­¿øµµ µ¿ÇØ½Ã µ¿±¼·Î 50,37.517365,129.1102094

Omar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Interesting...,donghae is a small town without much to do in the winter and early spring time  this cave is one of its few attractions located in the center of the city  inside the cave everything is well lit and has a metal pathway with rails and ladders  this is a definite must do,"March 23, 2016",Ãµ°îÈ²±Ý¹ÚÁãµ¿±¼,°­¿øµµ µ¿ÇØ½Ã µ¿±¼·Î 50,37.517365,129.1102094
Lainchan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,stop by if you have a lot of time to spare,small cave by city center  if you have a lot of time in donghae  you can come by and visit  else  skip and go to bigger caves in samcheok  remember to wear helmet coz i m 5 2  and my head still bumped into some rocks  if you are interested to buy the bracelets made from rocks  i suggest you buy here  it is cheaper here than in other caves in samcheok,"January 21, 2016",Ãµ°îÈ²±Ý¹ÚÁãµ¿±¼,°­¿øµµ µ¿ÇØ½Ã µ¿±¼·Î 50,37.517365,129.1102094
Susiesuky15,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Caves in the city,nothing special as compared to the bigger caves  height may be a problem as you may get knocked if not careful  not to worry as they are helmets available before you enter  the only highlight was that it is in the middle of donghae city and the caves are pretty well lit by the led lights which makes it rather nice  the different stalactites you see may require a little bit of imagination though,"November 1, 2015",Ãµ°îÈ²±Ý¹ÚÁãµ¿±¼,°­¿øµµ µ¿ÇØ½Ã µ¿±¼·Î 50,37.517365,129.1102094
Eric K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Can't beat the price,if you have been to other caves  then this one is nothing special  if you haven t seen many caves  then by all means take a look  we were in donghae in the heat of summer  so it was a nice escape from the heat there were a couple spots that were a bit challenging for a 6  2  person like myself  but nothing too bad,"September 9, 2015",Ãµ°îÈ²±Ý¹ÚÁãµ¿±¼,°­¿øµµ µ¿ÇØ½Ã µ¿±¼·Î 50,37.517365,129.1102094
Marjatta83,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice sight in the middle of Donghae city,nice sight for a couple of hours  very easy to access  as it is located in the middle of city  entrance fee was very cheap  if you want to see a bigger  huge  version of limestone cave  head inlands towards taebaek and samcheok  there is bigger cave called hwanseongul,"July 8, 2015",Ãµ°îÈ²±Ý¹ÚÁãµ¿±¼,°­¿øµµ µ¿ÇØ½Ã µ¿±¼·Î 50,37.517365,129.1102094
Nexus1984,4.0 of 5 bubbles,When asians find a cave...,the cheongok cave is pretty close to the city center  10 15 min walk from the hotel cluster southeast of the main traffic circle  it is easy to find  the entrance features a parking lot  a little pagoda and a small shop  there is also a tiny but nice and clean gallery atop of the cave entrance giving a little more background information about caves and the past periods of earth history in general  upon entrance you receive a helmet and you can put your stuff into one of the provided lockers  use the helmet  otherwise you will die because of cranial fracture  easy as this  i m an athletic person of average height  able to crouch and take care of myself  still i ran into stalactites i didn t see or expect  the cave itself is a nice place featuring several interesting rock formations formed by the ages  it is not a particular maze  you will always find your way along the metal walkways  and as a good cave  it s chilly and wet down there  the cave stretches approx  1 4 kilometers  with it s deepest parts preserved and therefore not accessible for visitors  entrance is 3000 won for regular adults  it s a nice exception from other things to do in donghae and absolutely worth a visit  what made me smile was the fact that the koreans who prepared the cave for visitors did this by using a lot of multicolored led strings and spotlights  which at some points turns parts of the cave in every color of the rainbow  something unlikely to encounter in europe  but this resembles the asian affection for multicolored lighting that one can see in their nightly cities  an additional minor flaw was the lack of english explanations which surely would have been interesting  anyway  considering the small entrance fee and the easy accessibility  this is a nice attraction worth your time while being in donghae,"September 12, 2014",Ãµ°îÈ²±Ý¹ÚÁãµ¿±¼,°­¿øµµ µ¿ÇØ½Ã µ¿±¼·Î 50,37.517365,129.1102094
