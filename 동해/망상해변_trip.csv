kimahrikku,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very long beach that extends seemingly forever,mangsang beach was a very nice surprise  the beach is huge  stretching for kilometers  the sand is nice and the water clean  the water gets deep very steeply  so it can be dangerous  and lifeguards have no tolerance for those who step outsied of the designated swimming areas  another good thing is that the beach is not only long  but it s also wide  which is great for people who want to play soccer  fly a kite or just want some extra room to run around  finally  the central area of the beach has a nice area whit various dining options  coffee shops  small stores and even a small arcade,"September 14, 2015",망상해변,강원도 동해시 망상동 393-16,37.5936891,129.090819

Nexus1984,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great location with minor flaws,we  me   my fianc   visited mangsang beach in the middle of september  which should normally be monsun time  but this day was sunny and hot  in any case it was after season and additionally during the week  which resulted in the beach being almost empty  unfortunately   no swimming  signs were killing the fun right away  most likely due to strong waves and currents at this day  this was a shame as the beach is very nice and the clear  not too cold water would have made a great time  so we decided to just walk along the water in the southern direction   and here is what you should absolutely be aware of  the southern part of mangsang beach is a restricted military area  which is announced by one     small sign in korean language only  photo attached   rule of thumb  if you see barbwire to your right and the sea to your left  better turn around  we walked almost one kilometer into the restricted area  which features some nice parts of the beachline like rocks and a creek leading into the sea  before some heavily armed south korean soldiers hastily jumped on their watchtower and blew their whistles to signal us to turn around immediately  given that there are other watchtowers and some cctv cameras before that  someone clearly wasn t doing his guard shift correctly    why didn t we turn around long before  easy   this far up north  basically the whole south korean coastline is fortified against north korean infiltration attempts using mini subs  one can see soldiers patrolling along the beach on other locations  too  so the barbwire itself did not work as a particular warning to us   enough of the scary stuff  the rest of the beach is wonderful and  given good wave conditions  clearly is an awesome place to go swimming  there were some quads and jetskis lying in front of a store  i assume they re for rent  and there are also stationary caravans to rent for a camping experience  there s also an italian style restaurant called  piano  run by koreans  close to the main vehicle entrance to the beach  a very neat place with little above average prices  but very good food  a tasteful interior and a beautiful view at the sea,"September 12, 2014",망상해변,강원도 동해시 망상동 393-16,37.5936891,129.090819
Julbo09,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Large beach, rude lifeguards",the beach is long and wide  so there are lots of people and no shortage of space on the sand  there are also lots of shops and restaurants  loud speakers  and the constant whistles of obnoxious  speedo clad  horrifyingly small   lifeguards  it s not a relaxing or quiet experience  but could be fun for families and groups who d like a lot of space   the beach sand has a pretty sharp drop off to the water  which makes for pretty hard waves and a strong current i suppose  the lifeguards are very strict about people going out in the water  i will grant them that it s pretty dangerous  especially for people not used to the ocean or young swimmers  but they whistle non stop and very rudely order you back out of the water  i was literally standing in water up to my shins when i was whistled   one guy in a tube went out in the water a good deal further than they liked and four lifeguards dramatically swam out and pushed him back to the sand   stick to the small and pleasant beaches around donghae  mangsang s waves and surf is tough and the lifeguards ruin it anyway,"August 1, 2014",망상해변,강원도 동해시 망상동 393-16,37.5936891,129.090819
