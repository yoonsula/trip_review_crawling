0,PAINT Brush, 4 stars ,really cool cave  if you re over 6 feet there will be some tight spots and head banging  exploration doesn t take long and there is a small museum on the second floor of the building  there is parking on site paid for when you buy your cave ticket  there is a park and trail nearby  so after the cave head on a nice walk in the park,a month ago
2,dearsindy, 5 stars ,a great place to visit when you want to cool off for the summer  these naturally cool caves have interesting formations and fun  wacky tunnels to entertain and keep you engaged   they give safety helmets for protection  when it rains  the caves are closed due to risks in flooding,a year ago
3,Nikky Saint-Aubin, 4 stars ,nice and cool even during the summer  but honestly don t know if it s worth the price  especially with a toddler in tow,a week ago

5,Judy Alkema, 3 stars ,small but well laid out cave experience   metal grid walkways and railings  some areas can be slippery with the damp environment   helmets mandatory and provided   the roof is low throughout but in most places visitors can walk upright    a few areas are tight either horizontally or vertically   two areas of the cave are listed as more challenging to access  and those over 60 are recommended a short cut alternative route which avoids those areas and shortens the total circle route   one involved a set of steps only about 18 inches wide that had to be descended by sitting and bumping down as the overhead height would not permit of stepping down   one of the party members is plus size and 5 8   and was able to navigate all tight spots unassisted  but apart from the suggested detours there are no accommodations for mobility reduced or disabled    children should be able to ascend stairs  hold handrails  and walk at all times  as the trails are narrow   i would recommend at least 5 years of age to be able to follow directions and enjoy the natural environment   formations are erratically protected from visitors    in places a metal grid is erected overhead  apparently to dissuade the breaking off of miniature stalactites   in other areas the roof and floor formations are fully within reach and in still others it is unavoidable to pass an area without touching them   the cave does seem to be free of litter or graffiti   there are name signs for some but not all of the focal features on the map  there are audio tour icons on the signs  but we weren t offered headsets and didn t see other visitors using them    names are in both english and korean   but not the details   maps do come in english  korean  chinese  and russian  to the best of our recollection   there are  for better or worse  few attempts to  add value  to the cave   no real bats  apparently very rare    no videos or zoological displays  little scientific detail  no son et luminiere  one twinkle star projector in the largest cavern   of the sort you might buy for your yard at christmas  and a flickering projector showing the cave logo as you enter    no bat  or geologically  related souvenirs in the gift shop aside from a handful of stone and faux stone jewelry pieces  no costumed mascots or plushies for the tots   no food services on the premises   there is a multimedia  ride  in the large building above the cave but was closed  due to covid  during our visit in august 2021    admission was inexpensive   around 5000 won for an adult ticket if memory serves   summary  if you like caves for themselves  are reasonably mobile  and want to spend a summer afternoon out of the heat doing something that isn t one of donghae s great beaches  give the cheongok cave a try,a year ago

295,TAKUYA _O, 3 stars ,a limestone cave in the town  rent a helmet and take a walk  4000w per adult  you can go around in less than 1h  it s a little narrow  but you can easily go there  wonder                                  4000w 1h,a year ago
362,Елена Моряна, 5 stars ,if you find yourself in dongha  be sure to visit this place  the walk will take only half an hour  but you will just visit the cave of the mountain king  the paths are very convenient and safe  you will not have to break your legs  and your head will be protected by helmets  in some places  the ceilings are low and the helmets will come in handy  believe me  the illumination is very nicely done    ,3 years ago
