1,Babo Kapi, 4 stars ,beautiful place and have many restaurant  should come in day time is better because can see everything well more than night time,9 months ago
2,Kim's Adventures, 5 stars ,it was a good hiking adventure  we could see the candle rock and go on a suspension bridge as well  you definitely need to watch your step as you walk up some of the steps as they are not all even wood steps but stone steps as well   it is a popular place and has some new restaurants and dry food shops to visit  you can even go camping around the area  however  i wouldn t suggest it since there are no shaded camp sights making it very hot  if you have a tarp you can put above your tent it shouldn t be so bad,a year ago
