Julbo09,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful View,the small park there at the chotdaebawi offers some great views of the surrounding rocks and water  the water was very clear and a beautiful color  rivaling a lot of the awesome beaches in southeast asia which was quite surprising to me  you go up a few stairs to get an elevated view   the beach nearby is very nice as well  the water was cold in late july  but considering most swimmers wear wet suits or at least rash guards  i m guessing it doesn t get very warm   it s a good distance from the hotel areas in donghae  the taxi there was more than 11 000 because we were charged some extra fee  i don t know if that was legitimate or not because we  luckily and easily  got a taxi back and it was only about 7 or 8 000   there were no taxis around the area when we were leaving  just happened that one was dropping someone off and we were able to get it  it might be necessary to call a taxi to get back to the city,"August 1, 2014",촛대바위,강원도 동해시 북평동 촛대바위길 28,37.4793444,129.160125
Linda T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Romantic Very good beach,this group of rock formations is beautiful and there is a small temple set on a craggy cliff  the beach is excellent both for strolling and swimming when it s warm enough  there are some good seafood places near by  a few places will have ho bak dong dong ju  pumpkin rice wine that is a local speciality  one can only get on the east coast  give it a try it s worth the experience  local buses run from both samchuek and donghae  a taxi will cost less than 10 000 from the dong hae bus terminal  if you have some time in the area  it is worth the effort to go here  especially if you like a more secluded beach,"November 21, 2013",촛대바위,강원도 동해시 북평동 촛대바위길 28,37.4793444,129.160125
