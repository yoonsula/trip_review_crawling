Afiqah A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice place for sight-seeing,it is a nice place for sight seeing  the view was quite wonderful  its just that you have to walk down as it is hard to find taxi up there  the cafe nearby the lighthouse gives a spectacular view of the ocean and it was a very nice and cozy cafe too  good place to relax   8 10 for view,"September 16, 2016",묵호등대,강원도 동해시 해맞이길 289 묵호항로표지관리소,37.5545919,129.1185443

kimahrikku,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Relaxing, with great views on the sea, the city and the mountains",the lighthouse itself is nice  but it s not spectacular  actually  there is nothing amazing on its own near the lighthouse  what s great is the overall atmosphere  you can see people coming in for the climb  others genuinely interested in the lighthouse  others just coming in from the sea  and people from the small houses in the neighborhood just strolling by  there are also a couple of small caffes overlooking the ocean that are really cozy and perfectly located  i recommand heading north after the bridge and crossing on the rope bridge to get to the hill on the other side and get great photos of the beach and its surroundings,"September 14, 2015",묵호등대,강원도 동해시 해맞이길 289 묵호항로표지관리소,37.5545919,129.1185443

AfflatedMizzlinG,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nothing particularly special,this lighthouse appeared in a number of k dramas movies  hence there is some popularity among fans  near the lighthouse is a small cafe where you can get a drink and enjoy the view  and a footpath to the red suspension bridge featured in  brilliant legacy    other than this having been featured in dramas and movies  i can t say what is so special about this place  there s a lighthouse  ok  there s a view of the sea  but not the best i ve come across in east coast  the bridge was disappointing  it looked better in the drama    drop by only if it s on your way  you don t need more than half an hour here,"December 3, 2011",묵호등대,강원도 동해시 해맞이길 289 묵호항로표지관리소,37.5545919,129.1185443
