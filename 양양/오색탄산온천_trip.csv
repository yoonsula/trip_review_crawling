Tom0326,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Korean hot spring with atmosphere of Japanese hot spring recuperation,hot spring facility attached to osaek greenyard hotel  because it is at the foot of mt  seolak which takes an hour from gangneung  there is no bustling feeling  and it has made a great contribution  the facility is ragged with the atmosphere full of showa  but the hot spring is properly done  i think that you like it if you like the atmosphere like a hot spring place,22-Feb-18,오색탄산온천,강원도 양양군 서면 대청봉길 34,38.0810224,128.4477418
joshvam8,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mountain korean sauna,located at osaek greenyard hotel  nice hot spring facility in the b2 level of greenyard hotel  the hotel and facility was built some years ago  with little or no renovations  giving the place a time capsule file in a good way  the hot spring facility is a traditional korean sauna  despite its obvious age  the surfaces and water were clean  didn t notice any sliminess on bath surfaces   relatively high ceilings and super spacious  there were no windows  which is typical for korean saunas  but with high ceilings and lighting  it didn t feel gloomy as some korean saunas bathhouses can  there were 41c and 43 bathes  and enormous 38c bath  two 27c pools  the carbonated acid pool  no temperature  but guessing 27c   hot and dry saunas and finally two small footpaths   one cold and one ambient  there seemed to be an outdoor bath  but it was apparently closed  signage in korean   great location right in the seorak mountains,19-Feb-17,오색탄산온천,강원도 양양군 서면 대청봉길 34,38.0810224,128.4477418
papertowel27,4.0 of 5 bubbles,my favorite spa in Korea,i ve visited several natural spas  oncheon     in korea  and this one is my favorite  i d say it compares to mid range japanese mountain resort onsens in variety and quality  it s also cleaner than any other spa i ve visited in korea  although it could be cleaner  there are two tiers for pricing  the base price allows entries to the baths only  while the higher price allows entry to the baths and a selection of co ed dry saunas  note that the carbonated spring itself is actually not hot  but there are several hot baths to warm up in  mugwort bath  hinoki bath  pine needle bath  alkali bath  etc   the spa is connected to the greenyard hotel  but anyone can use the spa  you can get here via an approximately 40 minute ride on bus number 1 from yangyang  which picks up every 60 to 90 minutes across from yangyang traditional market  among other places,14-Sep-16,오색탄산온천,강원도 양양군 서면 대청봉길 34,38.0810224,128.4477418
