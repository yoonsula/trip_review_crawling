papertowel27,4.0 of 5 bubbles,my favorite spa in Korea,i ve visited several natural spas  oncheon     in korea  and this one is my favorite  i d say it compares to mid range japanese mountain resort onsens in variety and quality  it s also cleaner than any other spa i ve visited in korea  although it could be cleaner  there are two tiers for pricing  the base price allows entries to the baths only  while the higher price allows entry to the baths and a selection of co ed dry saunas  note that the carbonated spring itself is actually not hot  but there are several hot baths to warm up in  mugwort bath  hinoki bath  pine needle bath  alkali bath  etc   the spa is connected to the greenyard hotel  but anyone can use the spa  you can get here via an approximately 40 minute ride on bus number 1 from yangyang  which picks up every 60 to 90 minutes across from yangyang traditional market  among other places,14-Sep-16,오색탄산온천,강원도 양양군 서면 대청봉길 34,38.0810224,128.4477418,trip adivisor
