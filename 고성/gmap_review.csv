156,Julie Songhwa Joung,,oh i loved this place  will definitely bring my family here  i stayed in geumho resort for two days and moved here for two days  geumho is too crippy and old  they gave a room with a  great view so i was okay to stay there alone but cleaning and infra was not satisfying at all  on the other hand  here in delfino resort owned by daemyung resort company  had a very well equipped and clean rooms with great support and service  it has pretty big water park and golf course and the mountain view was quite moody when it rained and got foggy  but no room service and i heard that food there was not very good   havn t had on my own   recommend   ,,델피노골프앤리조트

474,B. Y. Furuike,,i have mixed feelings about this place  because it had some excellent things about it and some terrible things about it  the excellent things about this place  lots of parking  exterior of this place was very well maintained  water pressure was excellent  interior was clean  the building we were in  the sono moon tower  east  was nice  but old  our room  the patio door would not open and we could not tell if the door was locked or not  but since you could not open it  it did not matter  there were too few electrical outlets  there were no place to hang coats or clothes  no microwave  they did have a stove to cook  the room door lock was worn out  it was difficult to lock and unlock the door  this is a pet friendly room  you must provide a hard copy of your pets vaccination  in particular the rabies vaccination  you must use the leash they provide you with  it allows them to know that the pet is the registered animal  they do provide you with water and food bowl  pee pads  cushion  ramp for you pet to use to get up to your bed ,,델피노골프앤리조트
