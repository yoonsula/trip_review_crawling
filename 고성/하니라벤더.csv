729,CJ Dayrit, 4 stars ,great place in goseong  it is important to come over here during summer and during the lavender festival when the lavenders are in full bloom  the colors are amazing  can be a bit crowded  entrance is 3k won per pax   go try some refreshments here especially the lavender lemonade and lavender ice cream  also they are selling other lavender products as well   it is a farm not a field so if you are planning for an epic photo  don t expect too much   staff are friendly   fun place   how to get here  take bus from dongseoul terminal  it is a 2 5 hr from ride and alight at ganseong bus terminal and take cab from there  10k won   a day trip is doable,4 years ago
740,Ka Ling (Drkyling), 4 stars ,beautiful lavender experience  but honestly a little underwhelming for the 3 hour ride from seoul  the lavender farm was rather busy with locals  and had two major lavender clusters   the clusters were rather packed with people eager to take photos but you could definitely find clear spots if you re patient  the larger cluster had more dense lavender but also more tourists taking photos  the other cluster was rather sparse and some were very small   my favorite was the lavender ice cream  3500 won   the flavor was light and the ice cream texture wasn t especially smooth but the ice cream was a welcome delight after all the photos around the farm   the owners did have tourists and photographers in mind when designing the farm as there were multiple spots available for photo taking   telephone booth  bench  european style houses   about 45 minutes is more than enough to take pictures and walk around the farm  the small lavender flower packs were a great deal  1500won  for souvenirs   i ll definitely hire mr denny yu from toursbylocals if you re interested for a private tour from seoul  our family of 11 wouldn t have made it to the farm otherwise,4 years ago
