0,Sagar Mali, 5 stars ,"This ks Unesco World Heritage Site. Get some YouTube information about the history and then visit. There's archery tickets through which you can try archery, it's nice. There's car ticket which will ride you to the most of outer side of the fortress. Very well maintained and must visit. There's a balloon ride nearby, you can try that too.",17 hours ago,[],[]

9,Anthony in Korea, 5 stars ,"(Translated by Google) One of the places that I think anyone who travels and loves to travel should visit once when coming to Korea. Hwaseong Citadel is more than a historical site with many beautiful places, but also a space where we can forget the hustle and bustle of life and immerse ourselves in the architectural space, watching the modern city also around from the city gate. How wondrous it is!
Especially visiting Hwaseong Haegung Palace at night is also an experience worth trying, try going with your lover or crush, it will be very romantic ❤️🥰

Một trong những địa điểm mà mình nghĩ rằng bất kỳ ai đi du lịch và yêu thích du lịch cũng nên 1 lần ghé qua khi đến với Hàn Quốc. Thành cổ Hwaseong nó hơn cả một di tích lịch sử với rất nhiều địa điểm đẹp mà còn là cả một không gian nơi ta có thể quên đi tất bật của cuộc sống và hoà mình vào không gian kiến trúc, ngắm nhìn thành phố hiện đại cũng quanh từ cổng thành. Thật là diệu kỳ biết bao!
Đặc biệt vào thăm điện Hwaseong Haegung ban đêm cũng là một trải nghiệm rất đáng để thử, hãy thử đi cùng người yêu hay crush của bạn, sẽ lãng mạn lắm í ❤️🥰",a week ago,[],[]

47,pagi pagi, 5 stars ,"(Translated by Google) When I went to Korea about 3 years ago, I looked around.
It's very spacious and impressive.

It is for a citadel and is made to make you feel the Great Wall of China.
In the old days, it would have been active as a defense base to prevent external enemies here.

It's wide, so if you walk around, it will take an hour.
However, I think you can enjoy the view from the wall.

From Seoul, because I went on a sightseeing plan
I went by a shared bus.

You can also go by train.
It seems that you can go by taxi, but it seems that the price is reasonable.

３年ほど前に韓国に行った際、見て回りました。
大変広く、見ごたえがあります。

城塞の用で、少し万里の長城を感じさせるような作りです。
昔は、外部の敵をここで防ぐための、防衛拠点として活躍していたのでしょう。

広いので、歩いて見て回ると、かるく１時間はかかります。
でも、城壁から見る景色もよく楽しめると思います。

ソウルからは、私は観光のプランで行ったため、
相乗りのバスで行きました。

電車でも行けるそうです。
タクシーでも行けるそうですが、そこそこ値段はするそうです。",a month ago,[],[]

73,Yuki Liu, 5 stars ,"(Translated by Google) very beautiful place! ! ! It may take a lot of time to walk the whole process, but it is worth it~ There are different aesthetics from different angles😍 You can also look at the unique coffee streets of Suwon while walking, and the buildings of the cafes also have their own characteristics☕️ In addition, because many idol dramas will come to the vicinity of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress to film scenes, people who are chasing dramas will also see similar scenes while walking~!

很漂亮的地方！！！全程走完可能會花很多時間但很值得～從不同角度看都有不同的美感😍 邊走還可以邊挑望水原獨特的咖啡街道，咖啡廳的建築也都各有各的特色☕️ 除此之外，因為有很多偶像劇都會來水原華城附近取景，有在追劇的人走著走著也會看到似曾相似的場景～！",a month ago,[],[]
75,Agata zhmogeliukas, 5 stars ,This is a MUST VISIT place if you ever come to Suwon! The fortress is free to visit and you can go up the defense wall and also see the city views from the above! There is also a beautiful pond that is popular for picnics and especially in summer it was super beautiful as everything was green and reflecting in the water! I am sure it is just as beautiful at other seasons as well!,a month ago,[],[]

183,Martin Bois, 4 stars ,"(Translated by Google) Very beautiful fortress, remnant of the former palace of King Jeongjo who moved the capital from Seoul to Suwon. Several buildings are present along the walls: gates, guard posts, archer towers, barracks, etc... Small explanatory panels are present all along in Korean and English and give some summary explanations. Due to covid, the visit was free. Normally, it only costs a few thousand Won to enter the main buildings.
Paid (but inexpensive) activities are present on the course. You can ring the bell of the fortress for 1000W and try your hand at archery for 2000W, it's nice, I recommend it!
If the urban passages of the walk can be confusing, so strong is the contrast between the fortress and the huge blocks of buildings that make up the background, the passage high up on the hill is more calm and pleasant. It takes a few hours to take your time around it and the place is worth a look day or night to see a piece of Korean history. On the other hand, I advise you to document yourself beforehand.

Très belle forteresse, vestige de l'ancien palais du roi Jeongjo qui avait fait déplacer la capitale de Séoul à Suwon. Plusieurs bâtiments sont présents le long des murailles : portes, postes de gardes, tours d'archers, casernes, etc... Des petits panneaux explicatifs sont présents tout le long en coréen et en anglais et donnent quelques explications sommaires. En raison du covid, la visite était gratuite. En temps normal, il ne coûte que quelques milliers de Won pour rentrer dans les principaux bâtiments.
Des activités payantes (mais peu chers) sont presentes sur le parcours. Vous pourrez faire sonner la cloche de la forteresse pour 1000W et vous essayer au tire à l'arc pour 2000W, c'est sympa, je vous le conseille !
Si les passages urbains de la balade peuvent dérouter, tant le contraste entre la forteresse et les énormes barres d'immeubles qui constituent le fond est fort, le passage en hauteur sur la colline est plus calme et sympathique. Il faut quelques heures pour en faire le tour en prenant son temps et le lieu vaut le coup d'œil de jour comme de nuit pour appercevoir un morceau d'histoire coréen. Par contre je vous conseille de vous documenter au préalable.",3 months ago,[],[]

186,Peter Lin, 5 stars ,Suwon Hwacheong Fortress. A UNESCO heritage world site. I came thinking that the fortress is located somewhere but it turns out that there is a town located within the fortress (makes sense since Hwaseong Haenggung Palace or also known as the Hwaseong Temporary Palace is located inside here too) and that includes their famous fried chicken street. Walked along the walls from the northern gate to the south eastern gate before my legs reminded me I’m getting old.,3 months ago,[],[]

You can also experience outdoor archery, the explanation is very detailed, and it is very good to grasp the essentials. The bow and arrow are quite heavy 😊
