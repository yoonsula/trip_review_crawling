9,Anthony in Korea, 5 stars ,one of the places that i think anyone who travels and loves to travel should visit once when coming to korea  hwaseong citadel is more than a historical site with many beautiful places  but also a space where we can forget the hustle and bustle of life and immerse ourselves in the architectural space  watching the modern city also around from the city gate  how wondrous it is  especially visiting hwaseong haegung palace at night is also an experience worth trying  try going with your lover or crush  it will be very romantic    ,a week ago

47,pagi pagi, 5 stars ,when i went to korea about 3 years ago  i looked around  it s very spacious and impressive   it is for a citadel and is made to make you feel the great wall of china  in the old days  it would have been active as a defense base to prevent external enemies here   it s wide  so if you walk around  it will take an hour  however  i think you can enjoy the view from the wall   from seoul  because i went on a sightseeing plan i went by a shared bus   you can also go by train  it seems that you can go by taxi  but it seems that the price is reasonable ,a month ago
48,Nick G, 5 stars ,a really great time exploring the fortress wall  i highly recommend hiking to the top of the archer tower for an amazing view of the city and a chance to ring the massive bell 3 timed for w1000 i really want to come back to explore the rest of the fort ,a month ago

73,Yuki Liu, 5 stars ,very beautiful place      it may take a lot of time to walk the whole process  but it is worth it  there are different aesthetics from different angles  you can also look at the unique coffee streets of suwon while walking  and the buildings of the cafes also have their own characteristics   in addition  because many idol dramas will come to the vicinity of suwon hwaseong fortress to film scenes  people who are chasing dramas will also see similar scenes while walking  ,a month ago
75,Agata zhmogeliukas, 5 stars ,this is a must visit place if you ever come to suwon  the fortress is free to visit and you can go up the defense wall and also see the city views from the above  there is also a beautiful pond that is popular for picnics and especially in summer it was super beautiful as everything was green and reflecting in the water  i am sure it is just as beautiful at other seasons as well ,a month ago

183,Martin Bois, 4 stars ,very beautiful fortress  remnant of the former palace of king jeongjo who moved the capital from seoul to suwon  several buildings are present along the walls  gates  guard posts  archer towers  barracks  etc    small explanatory panels are present all along in korean and english and give some summary explanations  due to covid  the visit was free  normally  it only costs a few thousand won to enter the main buildings  paid  but inexpensive  activities are present on the course  you can ring the bell of the fortress for 1000w and try your hand at archery for 2000w  it s nice  i recommend it  if the urban passages of the walk can be confusing  so strong is the contrast between the fortress and the huge blocks of buildings that make up the background  the passage high up on the hill is more calm and pleasant  it takes a few hours to take your time around it and the place is worth a look day or night to see a piece of korean history  on the other hand  i advise you to document yourself beforehand ,3 months ago
186,Peter Lin, 5 stars ,suwon hwacheong fortress  a unesco heritage world site  i came thinking that the fortress is located somewhere but it turns out that there is a town located within the fortress  makes sense since hwaseong haenggung palace or also known as the hwaseong temporary palace is located inside here too  and that includes their famous fried chicken street  walked along the walls from the northern gate to the south eastern gate before my legs reminded me i m getting old ,3 months ago
215,Tina TV (Miao Ying), 5 stars ,you can see the appearance of the city wall before  and it was the place where the king often came to play in the past  you can also experience outdoor archery  the explanation is very detailed  and it is very good to grasp the essentials  the bow and arrow are quite heavy  ,4 months ago
